## 1. The question and the rules

Goal: not "is the Qur'an a masterpiece" (untestable) but a disciplined empirical program —
**find a measure that demonstrably separates a known master from ordinary writing in its own
language (positive control), and only then apply it to the Qur'an.** Governing rules (DESIGN_STANCE,
DISCOVERY_CRITERIA): conviction guides the *search*, evidence decides the *claim*; the **telescope
rule** (non-detection means the tool is too weak, build a better one, never proclaim absence); the
**G10 gate** (a cross-text verdict is inadmissible unless it survives equal-N windows AND >=2
tokenizations against a same-language ordinary baseline, ideally >=2sd with bootstrap P); and
**multimodal fusion, no silver bullet.**

Four modalities were surveyed (surface statistics, architecture, sound, and their fusion), then the
strongest result was put through an adversarial same-genre control.

## 2. Results by axis

| Axis | Detector(s) | Verdict on the Qur'an |
|---|---|---|
| Surface statistics (#18-30) | entropy, MI, compression, n-gram repetition, variety | Mastery-blind or **register-level only**. The one consistent signal is long-range CONTENT repetition, **~+1.0-1.2sd vs classical Arabic (P~0.77), below the 2sd bar** (#28). |
| Cross-language frame (#27-30) | same battery on English/Arabic/Persian masters | Universal poetic-master signature = **rhythmic regularity + LOW repetition**; the Qur'an is the **inverse** (high repetition, no meter). Holds even vs a *same-language* master, al-Mutanabbi (#30). |
| Architecture — ring/chiasm (#31-32) | mirror-symmetry, lexical (Jaccard) + semantic (LSA), permutation null | **NULL corpus-wide** at every block scale (B=4-12), both lexical and semantic. No whole-surah ring signal. |
| Architecture — refrain (#33-33b) | periodic-placement of repeated ayat vs shuffle null | **Real but LOCALIZED**: 9/114 surahs; ar-Rahman z=+7.6; ordinary Arabic ~0. Not corpus-wide. |
| Sound — fasila/rhyme (#34) | verse-end rhyme concentration | **+2.5sd vs ordinary prose**, ~ comparable to poetry. First gate-passing corpus-wide signal. |
| Fusion (#35) | rhyme x meter x repetition x variety classifier | Qur'an separable from poetry AND prose at **AUC 0.94**; the interpretable rhyme x (non-)meter conjunction (0.92) beats either axis alone (0.76, 0.84). (Two tokenization artifacts caught and removed en route.) |
| Adversarial control — saj' (#36-37b) | vs al-Hamadhani + al-Hariri Maqamat | The bare "rhyme-without-meter" cell is **SHARED** with saj' (saj' 65% cell occupancy). The Qur'an still separates (AUC 0.96) via **rhyme PERSISTENCE** (dom +1.7sd: it sustains one fasila where saj' shifts) and **higher repetition + lower ornateness** (rep12 +1.1sd, yuleK +0.9sd). |

---

## 3. The cross-language synthesis (#30)

Measured profile of each register vs its ordinary baseline:

| Text | meter / rhythm | long-range repetition | lexical variety |
|---|---|---|---|
| Shakespeare (English) | uniform (-8sd) | LOW (-1.8sd) | HIGH |
| al-Mutanabbi (Arabic master) | uniform | LOW (rep8 -1.3sd) | HIGH (Yule -2.1, TTR +1.8) |
| Hafez / Rumi (Persian) | uniform (-8.5sd) | LOW (rep12 -1.4sd) | did NOT replicate |
| **Qur'an (Arabic)** | **prose-shaped (no meter)** | **HIGH (+1.0sd)** | ~ordinary |

The universal poetic-master signature (rhythmic regularity + low long-range repetition) holds in all
three languages. High lexical variety is a master signature in English and Arabic but not Persian.
The Qur'an is the systematic **inverse** on repetition, and this holds even against a same-language
master (Mutanabbi-vs-Qur'an: rep8 -2.5sd, TTR +6.5sd). The Qur'an is not built like verse.

---

## 4. Answering Q 36:69 empirically

The verse وَمَا عَلَّمْنَاهُ الشِّعْرَ وَمَا يَنبَغِي لَهُ denies that the Qur'an is *shiʿr*.
Classical definition: *shiʿr* = كلام موزون مقفّى (metered **and** rhymed). The measurements map onto
this exactly:

- **Not shiʿr:** the Qur'an has the *qafiya* (rhyme/fasila, +2.5sd vs prose, #34) but **not** the
  *wazn* (the meter axis is precisely what separates it from poetry, #30/#35). Rhyme without meter.
- **Then is it sajʿ (rhymed prose)?** It *shares* sajʿ's rhyme-without-meter (the #35 cell is not
  Qur'an-specific — #36/#37b). But it differs from the sajʿ masterworks on two axes: it **holds one
  rhyme across long passages** where sajʿ restlessly shifts (rhyme persistence dom +1.7sd, #37), and
  it is **more repetitive and less lexically ornate** than Maqamat sajʿ (#36).

So, empirically: it rhymes like verse (sustained), scans like nothing (no meter), and repeats like
oral formula — a combination none of poetry, ordinary prose, or sajʿ occupies.

## 5. Honest bottom line

> **UPDATE (modalities 7-9, EVIDENCE #40-42).** Three further lenses run. iltifat (#40) NULL vs ordinary;
> wazn (#41) register-level (+1sd, poetry-matched). **Intratextual recurrence (#42) is the magnitude
> breakthrough:** the structured-repetition distinctive, re-measured as long-range VARIED passage
> recurrence at equal-N — word-shuffle-controlled (not mere repetitive vocabulary) and verbatim-excluded
> (not refrains) — reads **+3.5-4sd vs ordinary Arabic**, the FIRST single axis to clear the 2sd bar. It
> does not overturn the picture below; it RAISES the central distinctive from "~+1sd, register-level" to
> ">2sd at passage grain," while confirming it is a recurrence-genre trait the Qur'an MAXIMISES (poetry
> also clears the bar at +2sd), not a unique kind. Search coverage now ~53% of the latent-feature space
> (see §6).

Across the earlier modalities and an adversarial control, the Qur'an's **one persistent, control-surviving
distinctive is STRUCTURED REPETITION** — real, consistent in direction, ordinary-absent; as a BULK RATE it
was **modest (~+1sd, register-level)**, but as **long-range varied passage-recurrence (#42) it reaches
+3.5-4sd** and clears the G10 bar. Secondary, genuinely robust findings: **rhyme persistence** distinguishes
it from sajʿ (+1.7sd), and a localized **periodic-refrain** device is real where present (ar-Rahman z=+7.6)
but confined to <10% of surahs. Whole-corpus ring/architecture is **null**. Bare rhyme is **shared with sajʿ**.

What this is NOT: a Qur'an-UNIQUE fingerprint — the one >2sd axis (recurrence) is shared in kind with
poetry. What it IS: a coherent, multimodal, positive-controlled characterization in which the Qur'an
occupies an unusual cell (sustained rhyme + no meter + maximal structured recurrence) that no neighbouring
register fully shares, with **the architecture of return** as its strongest single measurable signature.

**Self-ratings (honest, updated):** cross-language insight ~7/10; **recurrence-magnitude result (#42)
~7/10 (the first >2sd axis, but small baselines — magnitude provisional)**; sound/rhyme-persistence ~6/10;
fusion classifier ~6/10; Qur'an-specific *magnitude* vs ordinary Arabic now ~5/10 (up from 3/10, on #42);
decisive Qur'an-UNIQUE single-axis discovery ~2/10 (recurrence is elevated but shared in kind with poetry).

## 6. Search coverage (latent-feature space)

~58% of the full latent-feature space explored (up from ~46% pre-#40, ~53% pre-#44, ~56% pre-#45), weighting
layers by signal-bearing capacity: surface/statistical ~90% done, repetition/recurrence ~92% (sharpened by
#42, bug-fixed in #43), rhyme ~85%, architecture ~55%, fusion ~70%, phonosemantics ~60%, wazn ~70%, morpho-
syntax/iltifat ~35% (referent-blind), discourse/intratextual ~62% (recurrence #42 + macrostructure-sequencing
#44 done; argument/rhetorical-relation parsing still open), dependency-syntax ~35% (#45 parser-free
parataxis/hypotaxis proxy done; true embedding-depth / dependency-distance still needs a parser), and the
**recited/phonological layer ~0% (data-blocked, ~15% of the space)** — the single largest unexplored region,
and per the telescope rule the likeliest home of any remaining decisive distinctive.

TWO DENOMINATORS (important for "how close to done"): of the FULL latent space we are at ~58%, but ~27% of
that space is still gated on inputs we do not have in-session — the recited/vocalized prosody layer (~15%,
needs a tartil/syllable-weight corpus) and the DEEP part of dependency/discourse-relation syntax (~12%, needs
an Arabic parser; the shallow parataxis/hypotaxis proxy was opened parser-free in #45). The TEXT-ONLY
REACHABLE CEILING (what pure-text effort could still reach, leaving the gated layers aside) is ~78%: the
cheap, unblocked lenses are now essentially exhausted, and every one but recurrence (#42) came back
register-level/null. So the marginal return of more text-only lenses is low; closing the gap to a ~95%
target is gated on inputs we don't have — chiefly the recited/vocalized layer (~12-15 pts, the single
largest lever), plus the deep parser/coref parts of syntax and iltifat. See COVERAGE_MAP.html for the
per-modality impact ranking (lever-left toward 95%).

Per the telescope rule, every non-detection here used a **gate-validated instrument** (synthetic
positive control + degradation ladder + ordinary-negative), so these are honest "tool was adequate,
signal is modest/absent at this operationalization" results — not tool failures.

## 6. Limits and the cleanest next steps

- Magnitudes rest on modest non-Qur'an samples (Mutanabbi 2.6k words; Persian 0.76k; saj' 2k / two
  Maqamat authors; poetry corpus is hemistich-formatted).
- Rhyme is a last-2-letter approximation of the rawi; a true **pause-form saj'a-boundary parser**
  would sharpen the rhyme-vs-saj' comparison (currently clause-on-punctuation proxy).
- Saj' is represented by one genre (Maqamat); add **Nahj al-Balagha khutab** and rhymed khutba.
- Architecture tested only *mirror/ring* and *verbatim refrain*; verse-grain chiasm within delimited
  pericopes (Cuypers/Farrin claims) is untested and is confirmatory, not discovery.
- Untouched modality: deeper **phonosemantics** (sound-meaning binding) beyond end-rhyme.

## 7. Reproducibility

Scripts (`sequence_tests/`, run `python3 <script>` from there; corpora in `sequence_tests/corpus/`):
`ar_master_battery.py` (#30), `fa_battery2.py` (Persian), `structure_battery.py`+`structure_scan.py`
(#31), `semantic_ring.py` (#32), `refrain_detect.py`+`refrain_near.py` (#33/#33b),
`sound_rhyme.py` (#34), `fusion_classifier.py` (#35), `fusion_saj.py` (#36), `rhyme_struct.py` (#37).
Corpora: Qur'an from `Book6.xlsx`; Mutanabbi `ar_poetry.txt` (aldiwan.net); Persian `fa_poetry.txt`
(ganjoor) + `fa_news.txt`/`fa_prose.txt` (BBC + esra.ir); ordinary Arabic `ar_tabari/classical2/
novel/news.txt`; saj' `ar_sajprose.txt` (OpenITI: al-Hamadhani + al-Hariri Maqamat). All detectors
share one normalization (`normalize_letters`) and a permutation/bootstrap null; each carries a
positive-control gate. No Qur'anic text is reproduced in any output — only token statistics.

---

## 8. Addendum — Phonosemantics (#38): the modality sweep, completed

The final untested modality, sound-meaning binding (phonetic iconicity), returned **null**. A general
test (does semantic similarity predict phonetic similarity beyond shared vocabulary?) gave the Qur'an
partial-corr +0.004 (z=+0.5), no higher than prose/poetry/sajʿ. The targeted form of the classical
claim — that harsh content is carried by heavy emphatic/guttural phonemes — was also null and in fact
slightly **reversed** (harsh āyāt 0.089 vs gentle 0.094, −0.12sd, P=0.47). Both tests were
gate-validated on a synthetic sound-meaning-bound text.

This completes a five-modality sweep (surface, architecture, sound-rhyme, fusion, phonosemantics),
every detector positive-control-gated. **Net: the Qur'an's only persistent, control-surviving
distinctives are structured repetition (~+1sd, register-level) and rhyme persistence vs sajʿ (+1.7sd).
No decisive, corpus-wide, >2sd, single-axis "mastery fingerprint" was found in any modality** — an
honest non-detection with adequate instruments, not a tool failure. The defensible positive statement
remains the conjunction: sustained rhyme + no meter + high structured repetition, an unusual cell no
neighbouring register fully shares.

---

## 9. Addendum 2 — Prosodic rhythm (#39): sixth modality, null at text level

Tartil-rhythm tested via isocolon (length-balance of adjacent pause-units) and CV-skeleton
metricality. Result: the Qur'an's isocolon (0.48) equals ordinary prose (0.48) and is below sajʿ
(0.75, the genuinely isocolonic register); its metricality is the lowest of all (no meter). No
Qur'an-distinctive prosodic rhythm at the text level. **Important caveat:** de-diacritized text lacks
the short vowels, madd, and pause phonology that carry *recited* tartil rhythm, so this is "no rhythm
recoverable from consonantal text," not "no rhythm" — a genuine data limitation requiring a vocalized/
recited corpus to resolve. With six modalities now swept, the conclusion is unchanged: the Qur'an's
only persistent, control-surviving distinctives are structured repetition (~+1sd) and rhyme
persistence vs sajʿ (+1.7sd); no decisive single-axis fingerprint in any text-computable modality.

---

## 10. Conclusion — the frontier, and where this program stops

After a six-modality sweep with positive-control-gated instruments, the program reaches a principled
stopping point. Restating the result plainly:

- **Established (robust, control-survived):** the Qur'an's only persistent distinctives are
  (1) **structured repetition** (~+1sd vs ordinary Arabic, register-level, below the 2sd bar), and
  (2) **rhyme persistence** — it sustains one fāṣila across passages where sajʿ shifts (+1.7sd,
  two Maqāmāt masters). The defensible *positive* statement is the **conjunction**: sustained rhyme +
  no meter + high structured repetition, an unusual cell no neighbouring register (poetry, prose, sajʿ)
  fully occupies. Empirically this is the content of Q 36:69's "not shiʿr," extended: not quite sajʿ
  either.
- **Not found (honest non-detections with adequate tools):** no decisive, corpus-wide, >2sd,
  single-axis "mastery fingerprint" in *any* text-computable modality — surface statistics,
  architecture (ring/refrain), phonosemantics, prosodic rhythm. These are telescope-rule non-detections
  (gate-validated instruments), not tool failures.

**The genuine frontier — and why this corpus cannot cross it.** Every modality here is computed from
*written, largely consonantal* text. The one modality the data cannot reach is **recited/vocalized
prosody** — syllable-weight rhythm, madd (vowel lengthening), ghunna, pause phonology — i.e. the layer
of *tartīl* in which the Qur'an's oral distinctiveness is traditionally located. Testing it would
require **vocalized comparison corpora** (poetry/prose/sajʿ with full diacritics, or recited audio),
which were not available here. The honest implication of the whole sweep is therefore pointed: if a
decisive Qur'anic distinctive exists beyond structured repetition, the evidence points to it living in
the **recited/phonological layer that consonantal text statistics structurally cannot observe** — not
in the lexical, architectural, or written-phonetic layers, which have now been swept and found
register-level or null.

**Methodological yield (reusable):** a battery of gate-validated detectors (each with a synthetic
positive control + degradation ladder + ordinary-negative + permutation/bootstrap null), a four-
language comparative corpus (Arabic Qur'an, Mutanabbi; Persian Hafez/Rumi/Saadi; English via prior
work) plus sajʿ controls (al-Hamadhānī + al-Ḥarīrī), and proven data pipelines (aldiwan, ganjoor,
OpenITI, esra.ir). This infrastructure is the durable asset; the next session that obtains a vocalized
corpus can run the recited-prosody test direc
